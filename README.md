# Human vs Snake AI â€“ Performance Comparison ðŸŽ®ðŸ¤–

This repository contains a Python project that compares how a **manual (human)** player and an **AI** perform in the classic Snake Game using `pygame`. The AI is tested using the **same food positions** as the human, and their performance is compared in terms of total moves and efficiency.

---
## Project Overview

- Manual gameplay: You control the snake with arrow keys.
- AI gameplay: The AI mimics the food sequence collected by the manual player and uses pathfinding to reach food.
- Final output: Shows both playersâ€™ food count, number of moves, efficiency, and accuracy comparison.

## Core Concepts Implemented

1. **Game Development using `pygame`**
2. **AI Pathfinding**
3. **Data Logging & Analysis**
4. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Number of moves taken
   - Food collected
   - Efficiency comparison
   - Accuracy of manual player based on AI performance
